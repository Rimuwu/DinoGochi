Your path is defined by you:\n- You can focus on developing your dinosaur, training it and unlocking new abilities.\n- Or engage in trading rare resources, building your own economy.\n- Or perhaps you want to explore the world, participate in events, team up with other players, or compete for the title of the strongest.\n\n✨ DinoGochi is an open sandbox where you choose your own playstyle.\n Grow, trade, explore, win — or just enjoy life with your dinosaur.",

The more care — the better the mood!\n\n👀 *Where to see the dinosaur's mood?*\nYou can see the current mood in your dinosaur's profile. We display it through special indicators and color tags.\n\n💥 *What does good or bad mood give?*\nWith a good mood, the dinosaur receives useful bonuses: develops faster, fights more successfully, and handles tasks more easily. With a low mood, nervous breakdowns are possible: the dinosaur may refuse to perform commands or lose motivation.",
